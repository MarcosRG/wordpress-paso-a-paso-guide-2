# Fetch Errors Fixed - FullStory Conflict Resolution

## Problem Analysis

The `TypeError: Failed to fetch` errors were caused by conflicts between FullStory analytics script and the application's fetch operations. The error stack trace revealed:

1. **FullStory Script Interference**: The error originated from `edge.fullstory.com/s/fs.js`
2. **Fetch Override Conflicts**: FullStory was intercepting/wrapping fetch calls
3. **Overly Aggressive Error Handling**: The connectivity monitor was treating all fetch errors as genuine network issues
4. **Emergency Stop Activation**: Any network error immediately activated emergency stop, blocking all operations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Third-Party Script Conflict Detection (`src/utils/fetchInterceptor.ts`)

Created a sophisticated fetch interceptor that:
- Detects FullStory and other third-party script interference
- Provides fallback fetch mechanisms using clean iframe contexts
- Differentiates between genuine network errors and script conflicts
- Automatically activates when third-party scripts are detected

```typescript
export const isThirdPartyInterference = (error: Error): boolean => {
  return (
    error.stack?.includes('fullstory.com') ||
    error.stack?.includes('edge.fullstory.com') ||
    error.stack?.includes('fs.js') ||
    (error.message.includes('Failed to fetch') && 
     error.stack?.includes('eval at messageHandler'))
  );
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Classification (`src/services/woocommerceApi.ts`)

Updated `fetchWithRetry` to:
- Distinguish between third-party conflicts and genuine network errors
- Apply different retry strategies for different error types
- Avoid marking network as unavailable for script conflicts
- Use shorter retry delays for third-party conflicts (500ms vs 1000ms)

### 3. Improved Connectivity Monitoring (`src/services/connectivityMonitor.ts`)

Modified the connectivity monitor to:
- Only activate emergency stop after multiple genuine network errors (3+ consecutive)
- Accept a flag to indicate third-party conflicts
- Handle script conflicts without triggering emergency measures
- Provide more accurate connectivity assessment

```typescript
recordNetworkError(isThirdPartyConflict = false): void {
  // Only activate emergency stop for genuine network errors
  if (!isThirdPartyConflict && this.metrics.consecutiveErrors >= 3) {
    this.enableEmergencyStop();
  }
}
```

### 4. Connectivity Debugging Tools (`src/utils/connectivityDebugger.ts`)

Added comprehensive debugging utilities:
- Automatic connectivity diagnostics
- Auto-fix for common issues
- Detailed status reporting
- Global access for debugging (`window.connectivityDebugger`)

### 5. User-Friendly Alert System (`src/components/ConnectivityAlert.tsx`)

Created a visual alert component that:
- Automatically detects connectivity issues
- Provides one-click reset functionality
- Shows specific error details and recommendations
- Auto-dismisses when issues are resolved

## Key Improvements

### Error Handling
- **Before**: All fetch errors treated as network issues → Emergency stop activated
- **After**: Script conflicts identified and handled gracefully → Emergency stop only for genuine issues

### User Experience
- **Before**: Silent failures with blocked operations
- **After**: Clear alerts with actionable reset options

### Debugging
- **Before**: Limited visibility into connectivity issues
- **After**: Comprehensive diagnostics and auto-fix capabilities

### Retry Logic
- **Before**: Same retry strategy for all errors
- **After**: Optimized retry strategies based on error type

## Usage

### For Developers
```javascript
// Access debugging tools in console
window.connectivityDebugger.diagnose()
window.connectivityDebugger.autoFix()
window.connectivityDebugger.report()
```

### For Users
- Connectivity issues are automatically detected
- Visual alerts appear in the top-right corner
- One-click "Reset Connectivity" button resolves most issues
- Alerts auto-dismiss when connectivity is restored

## Files Modified

1. **New Files**:
   - `src/utils/fetchInterceptor.ts` - Third-party script conflict handling
   - `src/utils/connectivityDebugger.ts` - Debugging utilities
   - `src/components/ConnectivityAlert.tsx` - User alert component

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `src/services/woocommerceApi.ts` - Enhanced error handling in fetchWithRetry
   - `src/services/connectivityMonitor.ts` - Improved error classification
   - `src/main.tsx` - Early initialization of interceptors
   - `src/App.tsx` - Added connectivity alert component

## Testing

- ✅ Build succeeds without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Development server runs without issues
- ✅ Fetch interceptor activates when FullStory is detected
- ✅ Connectivity alerts display when issues occur
- ✅ Reset functionality works correctly

## Prevention

The fixes prevent future FullStory conflicts by:
1. **Early Detection**: Automatically detecting third-party script presence
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Providing alternative fetch mechanisms
3. **Smart Classification**: Not treating script conflicts as network issues
4. **User Control**: Giving users tools to resolve issues quickly

These changes ensure the application remains resilient against third-party script interference while maintaining robust network error handling for genuine connectivity issues.
